So how has security adapted to face all these threats? Basically, the most modern idea is the idea of defense in depth, making it so the bad guys have to beat layer after layer of security in order to get in, and then back out. The go-to model is the cyber killchain by Lockheed Martin, and while it gets a ton of crap, it is honestly a very good way of looking at it.

Make sure you know the different layers of the killchain. 

Recon
Weaponization
Delivery
Exploitation
Installation
Command and Control
Actions on Objectives
One of the most common arguments against the killchain is that "Actions on Objectives" is too vague. For one, all of the other steps of the killchain can occur as an action on objective if the attacker uses it to attack something else, which is known as pivoting. But there are many other "post-exploitation" objectives of an attacker, which range from installing backdoors to bricking the device. 
There are 5 P's of Post-Exploitation:

Persistence = Find a way to maintain access 
Privilege Escalation = Find a way to get a higher level of access than you already have
Pilfer = Steal things
Pillage = Break things. 
Pivot = Move from one box to another and start the killchain all over again.
I will write a good post on this at some point, but for now, just try to remember what each of those things means. 



Tasks: 

Describe a hypothetical attack on a user via email, using your current understanding, from recon all the way through all the post exploitation possibilities. It is fine if you don't have the technical understanding, we are just trying to make sure you have the concepts down. You are going to look back at this scenario later in the course and do it again, once you have more technical concepts down.
