A Brief Note:

Hacking, to most people means breaking into things, and that's not wrong really. While some people might try to claim that should be referred to as "cracking", the ship has sailed. We are going to be teaching you how to do cool things with computers, particularly in regards to security, and very often, that is going to overlap with teaching you how to break into things. We'll go more into ethics a little further on, but for now, remember what Uncle Ben said: "With great power, comes great responsitrilitrust".
