Add this to the list of security truisms. 

Any network connected to the internet must be considered hostile. Most intranets should be considered hostile to. In fact, it is hard to imagine a more "hostile" network than a DoD network. 

But what does "hostile" mean? In this case, the general idea is that if computer A wishes to communicate with computer C, that means that they need to send all of their traffic through computer B. Gentleman's agreements not to look at that traffic might have worked on Arpanet, but not anymore. 

From Internet Service Providers (ISPs) working with governments to snoop on all your traffic, to deep sea submarine cable intercepts to sketchy free wifi hotspots, your internet browsing is recorded by a lot of people. 

This next section skips over the technical details of network ownage (while giving you plenty to research on your own time), and focuses on the principles that can protect you and specific steps you can take to protect yourself.
