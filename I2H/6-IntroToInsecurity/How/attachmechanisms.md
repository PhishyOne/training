<p></p><p>There are a lot of ways for you to get hacked, so there is no way we can go over them all.&nbsp;</p><p>But, we can go over good ways to think about this.&nbsp;</p><p>First, we can think about in terms of attack mechanisms as seen&nbsp;<a href="https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/1000.html">here</a>. This is a crazy useful resource that will require its own section someday.</p><p>List of Attack Mechanisms:</p><p></p><ul><li>Collect and Analyze Information&nbsp;<br></li><li>Inject Unexpected Items&nbsp;<br></li><li>Engage in Deceptive Interactions&nbsp;<br></li><li>Manipulate Timing and State<br></li><li>Abuse Existing Functionality<br></li><li>Employ Probabilistic Techniques&nbsp;<br></li><li>Subvert Access Control&nbsp;<br></li><li>Manipulate Data Structures&nbsp;<br></li><li>Manipulate System Resources&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>Task:&nbsp;</p><p>For each attack mechanism, describe in two sentences what the thing being attacked is and how they generally work. This is going to take some research, but shouldn't take all that long. You can click to expand to learn more about each type of attack.&nbsp;</p><br><p></p>
