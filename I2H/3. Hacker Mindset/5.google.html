There are very very few questions you are going to ask that Google can't answer. But sometimes your questions might be a little too vague to make sense, or you don't really know what you are trying to find out.

Luckily, you have people here who can help you. 

One of the best questions you can ask is for search terms on a subject. That way they don't have to spend time explaining it, and you get all the benefits of doing the research yourself.

You might already know some cool google tricks to get better results, but don't worry... we will teach you all of them.
