Learning this stuff isn't easy. The content is difficult, the scope of what there is to learn is tremendous, and the rate of innovation and change in this space makes keeping up seemingly impossible. If you are thinking right now that you'll never learn everything; you're right! There is an infinite amount to learn, so choose the stuff that interests you and learn that. This course is intended to give you a general base of knowledge so that you can succeed with anything you do, but if you want to be great you have to love what you're doing and keep getting after it. 

   

For the rest of your time computering, maintain a series of lists. I recommend a Google Sheets file with a bunch of tabs. These are just a few we recommend, I'm sure you'll make more.

          * Questions you don't know the search terms for

	  * Questions that google can't answer

	  * Things you want to learn how to do

          * Things you want to learn more about

          * Things you want to make or help make

          * Things you want to tell other people about or write about

          * Potential future reading material  

	  * Links to things you want to remember

 We will do our absolute best to help you keep these lists short. There will be section in the forums for random questions, from ELI5 style to "Make me a tutorial", or you can always just private message it, or put it up in Slack.
