<p>This guy is a bit of a jerk, but he has good content. We're not as mean as him, and I'll write something better eventually.</p><p>Read this: http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html<br></p><p>You can private message us, post on the forum, throw it on Slack, whatever. Just show you tried ahead of time and no one will ever get annoyed, because there is really no such thing as a bad question, just one you haven't researched enough.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're in person, just ask. It's faster than googling and you'll get more out of it.&nbsp;</p><p>We already told you what RTFM stood for, so now we're gonna have you do it.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Visit this <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/bash">man-page</a> and write down the first five things you don’t understand.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Then google them and figure out what they are. Submit 5 sentences explaining the 5 things you didn’t know.&nbsp;For the love of everything, don’t read any further once you are done with that. Remember Rule 3 of the Hacker Attitude, “Boredom and Drudgery are evil.” If you're not getting anything out of something, don't do it, and leave us feedback that we are wasting your time.</span></p><p></p>
