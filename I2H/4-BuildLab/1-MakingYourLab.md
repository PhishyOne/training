# Building Your Own Lab
## Introduction
Building your own lab is important for a lot of reasons, but most importantly it is fun and teaches you a bunch of valuable information. In this section we will do some work securing our daily lives and install a virtual machine for us to work on. What you will be making is uniquely yours and will be something that you will work on and refine for the rest of your time doing the computers. This is your new summer home, so take pride in what you are making and make it yours.

## Virtualization
Why do we use virtualization?

Write up a few sentences on the primary benefits of running a virtualized environment inside of your Windows machine.

## Installing Ubuntu in VMWare
Install VMware http://www.vmware.com/go/tryplayerpro-win-64

Install Ubuntu https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop

I could give you more information on what to do for this, but there are a ton of tutorials and youtube videos out there. Should be an easy google, and the information doesn't change. Let us know if you have any problems, but I recommend going step by step through a tutorial.

## Make it Yours
Now you need to make this house a home, have fun with it. This is a random smattering of things that I highly recommend you do, both for quality of life and for getting accustomed to how things work.

1. Update and Upgrade Everything: 
  What the heck is sudo? sudo https://www.lifewire.com/ubuntu-sudo-2205669
2. Install Google Chrome
  We've mentioned this before, but we don't explain much. You're going to need this for the tasks ahead!
3. Install VMWare tools for Ubuntu
You need this for a lot of critical usability things, and it doesn't come pre-installed. You have most likely already seen prompts telling you to do this. Do it. I'll be honest, this can be kinda difficult sometimes, but you gotta figure your own way through this.
4. Change Wallpaper
5. Install Unity Tweak Tool and do something interesting
6. file system nav https://www.lifewire.com/linux-commands-for-navigating-file-system-4027320
7. Use WINE to play Minesweeper: Yes, you can run Windows programs in Linux. It can get weird, but it works.
8. Install VLC Media Player
9. Sudo apt-get install tmux/terminator
10. Install sublime text
11. Create an alias or two
12. Create a bashrc
  These are called dotfiles, so named because they have a dot in front of their names. This makes them "hidden" files in the Linux directory system. We use them to do random things.
13. Create a vimrc
14. Make your terminal pretty
15. Install GIMP and make me a meme
16. Virtual workspaces: Switch between workspaces and use the tweak tool to do stuff.
