This curriculum was created based on inputs from members of the great classes of '15, '16, '17, and '18. We put this curriculum together by aggregating all of the guides on how to become successful in information security, took what we thought was important, added things of our own, and personalized it for the Academy. This is the first iteration of the curriculum online and it should change drastically as we see what does and doesn't work.
