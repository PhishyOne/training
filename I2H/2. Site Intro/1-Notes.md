# Site Introduction
## Content
This curriculum was created based on inputs from members of the great classes of '15, '16, '17, and '18. We put this curriculum together by aggregating all of the guides on how to become successful in information security, took what we thought was important, added things of our own, and personalized it for the Academy. This is the first iteration of the curriculum online and it should change drastically as we see what does and doesn't work.

## Feedback

After every section, we are going to ask for feedback. What did you like, not like, want changed, any thoughts. Just stream of consciousness it.

We can only get better if you tell us what you want changed, and you won't hurt our feelings. 

## Support
Our site provides real time support through instant messaging, or you can hit us in Slack or on the forums. Whatever works, we are here for you.
