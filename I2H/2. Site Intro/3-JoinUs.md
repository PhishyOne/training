## Slack
Instant group messaging has been a cultural staple of the internet community since its inception, as it is truly one of the most important functions that global interconnectedness can serve. In the beginning there was email, then bulletin boards systems (BBS), then Internet Relay Chat (IRC). Finally, there was Slack.

Slack has become the IRC replacement, allowing group collaboration and real time chat along with logs and file hosting integration. We use it for many of our conversations, and as our primary instant messaging channel

Join our channel at https://usnacst.slack.com/ and post a hello! Choose a handle for yourself that isn't your Alpha, we'll help you come up with something good eventually. 


## Mentors
Mentors are essential, and everyone here is available to be a mentor. If you have someone or a few people you want to be your mentor, submit their name(s). 

If you don't know anyone, don't worry about it, and we'll find someone who can help you out with whatever questions you have. 

## Partners
Everything is more fun when you have someone to do it with. You will be assigned someone (or a bunch of people) as your partner by your mentor, and you will work with them as you move forward in this process. We will hot swap partners as we go along. This doesn't mean you're done with them forever (unless you want to be), it just means you have another person to work with.

 If you have someone or a few people you want to be your partner(s), submit their name(s). 

If you don't know anyone, don't worry about it, and we'll find someone who you can work with. Remember, even if you are working on this alone and can't come to meetings, we can still find you a partner... or you can go and recruit some friends to work on it with you. The more the merrier! 

## Twitter

## Github
A major part of hacker culture is the idea of open source technology. GitHub is the modern center of the open source community, providing free hosting for millions of projects. In fact, the entire content of this site is on Github! A great deal of hacker cred is based around the things you create and release to the public, and the best way to do that is on GitHub.
