Everything is more fun when you have someone to do it with. You will be assigned someone (or a bunch of people) as your partner by your mentor, and you will work with them as you move forward in this process. We will hot swap partners as we go along. This doesn't mean you're done with them forever (unless you want to be), it just means you have another person to work with.

 If you have someone or a few people you want to be your partner(s), submit their name(s). 

If you don't know anyone, don't worry about it, and we'll find someone who you can work with. Remember, even if you are working on this alone and can't come to meetings, we can still find you a partner... or you can go and recruit some friends to work on it with you. The more the merrier!
