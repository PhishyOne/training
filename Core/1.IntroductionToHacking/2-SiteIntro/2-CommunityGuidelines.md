A Brief Note:

Hacking, to most people means breaking into things, and that's not wrong really. While some people might try to claim that should be referred to as "cracking", the ship has sailed. We are going to be teaching you how to do cool things with computers, particularly in regards to security, and very often, that is going to overlap with teaching you how to break into things. We'll go more into ethics a little further on, but for now, remember what Uncle Ben said: "With great power, comes great responsitrilitrust".

## Legal Stuff 
Unsurprisingly, you will learn some things that could be used to do bad things. You might not think they're bad things at the time, and they might seem like funny pranks, but the laws against hacking are very vague.

In the US, the law that surrounds this stuff is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. 

Basically, all you need to know is that every computer is a protected computer and that it is a crime to intentionally access a computer without authorization or exceed authorized access.

Exceed authorized access is a real sticky subject, and it has led to a bunch of terrible prosecutions. Remember Aaron?

To stay on the safe side, only access computers you own, or have written consent to access. You're lucky, because we have an entire network of training computers you can do whatever you want on. A lot of people don't, and that's where they get in trouble while trying to learn.  

It should also be mentioned that copyright law is also a good way to get in trouble, not to mention that if you see software to pirate on the internet, it is very unlikely that it doesn't contain malware. Just don't steal things, we can almost always get a copy of whatever you want, it just might take some paperwork.
