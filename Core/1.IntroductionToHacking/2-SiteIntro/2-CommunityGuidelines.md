A Brief Note:

Hacking, to most people means breaking into things, and that's not wrong really. While some people might try to claim that malicious hacking should be referred to as "cracking", the ship has sailed. We are going to be teaching you how to do cool things with computers, particularly in regards to security, and very often, that is going to overlap with teaching you how to break into things. We'll go more into ethics a little further on, but for now, remember what Uncle Ben said: "With great power, comes great responsitrilitrust".

## Legal Stuff
Unsurprisingly, you will learn some things that could be used to do bad things. You might not think they're bad things at the time, and they might seem like funny pranks, but the laws against hacking are very vague. Even more importantly, there is a strong chance that at some point you will need to apply for a security clearance, and having a pile of felonies you have to admit to is not a great look and will complicate your paperwork.

In the US, the law that surrounds this stuff is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

Basically, all you need to know is that every computer is a protected computer and that it is a crime to intentionally access a computer without authorization or exceed authorized access.

Exceed authorized access is a real sticky subject, and it has led to a bunch of terrible prosecutions. Remember Aaron Swartz?

To stay on the safe side, only access computers you own, or have written consent to access. You're lucky, because we have an entire network of training computers you can do whatever you want on. A lot of people don't, and that's where they get in trouble while trying to learn.  

It should also be mentioned that copyright law is also a good way to get in trouble, not to mention that if you see software to pirate on the internet, it is very unlikely that it doesn't contain malware. Just don't steal things, we can almost always get a copy of whatever you want, it just might take some paperwork.


## Code of Conduct

### 1. Purpose
A primary goal of Hopper's Roppers is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in this organization to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

### 2. Open Citizenship
A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

### 3. Expected Behavior
The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
Attempt collaboration before conflict.
Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

### 4. Unacceptable Behavior
The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
Inappropriate photography or recording.
Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.
Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.
Stealing any equipment.

### 5. Weapons Policy
No weapons will be allowed at our events, community spaces, or in other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon. Community members are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.

### 6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

### 7. Reporting Guidelines
If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, notify a community organizer as soon as possible. All members of the community are expected to report any unacceptable behavior and take immediate action if reporting will not stop the behavior in time to avoid a negative outcome.

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

### 8. Addressing Grievances
If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the staff with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies. [LINK_TO_POLICY]

[NOTE: Every organization’s governing policies should dictate how you handle warnings and expulsions of community members. It is strongly recommended that you mention those policies here or in Section 7 and that you include a mechanism for addressing grievances.]

### 9. Scope
We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
