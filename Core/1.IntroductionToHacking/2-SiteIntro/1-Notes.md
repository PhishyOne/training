# Site Introduction
## Why Security?

I fell in love with security a long time ago, and while the motivations behind my passion has changed, I love it now because the security community is the shield of the modern age. Without the constant battle on the frontlines between the people who want to see technology used for good and the people who want to use it for their own gain, or worse, to limit the rights and freedoms of others, the progress that occurs in the real world because of technology would be dramatically slowed. We allow trust in technology, which leads to adoption, which leads to progress. 

There are countless things you can do with technology to change the world: Teach other people. Build tools and tech able to solve real world problems. Create social movements. Empower everyone. I want to do all of those things. I probably will someday. But I want to start by helping other people learn to use their superpower, and help steer people in the right direction. That’s why this site exists, and hopefully, if you’re here for the right reasons, you’ll be able to jump into the fight with the tools you need to succeed. 

## Content
This curriculum was created based on inputs from members of the great classes of '15, '16, '17, and '18. We put this curriculum together by aggregating all of the guides on how to become successful in information security, took what we thought was important, added things of our own, and personalized it for the Academy. This is the first iteration of the curriculum online and it should change drastically as we see what does and doesn't work.

## Feedback

After every section, we are going to ask for feedback. What did you like, not like, want changed, any thoughts. Just stream of consciousness it.

We can only get better if you tell us what you want changed, and you won't hurt our feelings. 

## Support
Our site provides real time support through instant messaging, or you can hit us in Slack or on the forums. Whatever works, we are here for you.
