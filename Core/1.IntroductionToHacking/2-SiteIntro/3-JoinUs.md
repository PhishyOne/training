# Join Us!

## Slack
Instant group messaging has been a cultural staple of the internet community since its inception, as it is truly one of the most important functions that global interconnectedness can serve. In the beginning there was email, then bulletin boards systems (BBS), then Internet Relay Chat (IRC). Finally, there was Slack.

Slack has become the messaging platform of choice, allowing group collaboration and real time chat along with various plug-ins and file hosting integration. We use it for many of feedback, support, as a forum, and as our primary instant messaging channel. At some point we might migrate to a self-hosted server, but for now, Slack is the easiest to work with.

Join our channel at <https://launchpass.com/hoppersroppers> and post a hello!

Choose a nickname, or what we call online, a "handle" for yourself. Don't worry about it too much, you will come up with something good eventually, and you are not stuck with whatever you start with. As a general rule, don't call yourself something like "Dark Shadow". Unless you want to. In that case, do that. I probably had a dozen or so before settling on my current one, 'deevnull'. I liked mine because it is a nerd joke (that will be explained about halfway through this course) and incorporates my last name.  Send me a message with a brief introduction to let me know you joined. We use Slack for just about everything from helping on problems, submitting feedback, or just talking about random things.

## Mentors

Mentors are essential, and everyone here is available to be a mentor. If you have someone or a few people you want to be your mentor, message them on Slack to coordinate and submit their names. If you don't know anyone yet, don't worry about it, we'll find someone who can help you out with whatever questions you have.

## Partners
Everything is more fun when you have someone to do it with. You can be assigned someone (or a bunch of people) as your partner by your mentor, and you will work with them as you move forward in this process. We can swap partners as we go along, or you can just not have a partner at all.

If you have someone or a few people you want to be your partner(s), submit their name(s).

If you don't know anyone, don't worry about it, and we'll find someone who you can work with... or you can go and recruit some friends to work on it with you. The more the merrier! Remember, even though we are all working on this apart, we are in it together.

## Twitter
Unsurprisingly, information security Twitter is a very exciting place. In the modern age, where information flows at the speed of light, Twitter is the place to be if you want to stay informed and on the cutting edge. It is an overwhelming amount of information, so you want to start off following only a few accounts. It is going to be a lot for you right now to actually try to read and understand the firehose, so we will start you slow and with a small number of beginner-friendly follows that really only post news. If you don't want to do Twitter yet, just skip it.

### Optional:
Create a "professional" twitter account! Remember, this twitter will be able to be associated with you, even if you want to stay pseudo-anonymous. Always keep it fun and professional. Now subscribe to this list: <https://twitter.com/deevnull/lists/cst>. This list has been curated to only include must follows with a range of jobs that will provide insight into what is happening around the field.

Submit your twitter handle below so we can follow you. Again, if you don't want to do Twitter yet, just skip it. It is mostly just a giant waste of time, but it is interesting and you learn a ton.

## Github
A major part of hacker culture is the idea of open source technology. What is open source? We will go into it later, but basically it is distributing software for free so that people can use and make changes in order to build the best software possible. GitHub is the modern center of the open source community, providing free hosting for millions of projects. In fact, almost the entire content of this site is on Github! A great deal of hacker street cred is based around the things you create and release to the public, and the best way to do that is on GitHub. In this course, we use Github to learn good development practices so that you can be a more effective coder.

Read this to learn about what open source is: <https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source>

Then create a GitHub account and submit your username!

## Github Student (Students Only)
GitHub Student is an incredible offer that gives college students a starter pack of basically everything they could ever need to get started with any aspect of computing, from text editors to cloud hosting and more. With this you can make websites, rent cloud servers, and get a ton of other really cool stuff that can teach you a ton. You will use various things that are part of the Github student pack throughout later in your journey which will help you save money. If you aren't a student, don't worry too much, it's all pretty cheap.

Apply for this incredible gift pack: <https://education.github.com/pack>. It gets approved pretty quickly!

## The 'Competitive' Team
When you sign up for this site, you automatically become a member of our not-at-all competitive team, which also happens to be named Hopper's Roppers. This whole site is grown out of the training I made for my college security team which competed in various cyber security competitions. Now, Hopper's Roppers is a distributed team, open to anyone, but is especially meant to be a place for beginners to learn the ropes in and we will participate in any event we have the numbers for. 

The primary type of security competitions are CTFs, or Capture the Flags. This is a great resource to learn about CTFs. <https://ctfd.io/whats-a-ctf/>. All of the training here is built around the idea of preparing you for success in the security field, and there is no better measure of ability, grit, and the hacker mentality than playing in a competition. Every CTF requires you to use what you already know to identify what you will need to learn on the spot to solve the problem. As you are now a member of our team, we will let you know when competitions are occuring and we hope to see you there if you have the time. Even if you are new and don't think you have anything to contribute, you will learn more picking someone's brain as you shoulder-surf them (or watch them on Twitch) than you possibly could trying to learn by yourself.
