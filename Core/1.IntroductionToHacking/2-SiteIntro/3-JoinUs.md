## Slack
Instant group messaging has been a cultural staple of the internet community since its inception, as it is truly one of the most important functions that global interconnectedness can serve. In the beginning there was email, then bulletin boards systems (BBS), then Internet Relay Chat (IRC). Finally, there was Slack.

Slack has become the IRC replacement, allowing group collaboration and real time chat along with logs and file hosting integration. We use it for many of our conversations, and as our primary instant messaging channel

Join our channel at https://usnacst.slack.com/ and post a hello! Choose a nickname, or what we call online, a "handle" for yourself. Don't worry about it too much, you will come up with something good eventually, and you are not stuck with whatever you start with. I have had a dozen or so before settling on my current one, devnull. Send me a message with a brief introduction to let me know you joined. We use Slack for just about everything from helping on problems, submitting feedback, or just talking about random things. 


## Mentors
Mentors are essential, and everyone here is available to be a mentor. If you have someone or a few people you want to be your mentor, submit their name(s). 

If you don't know anyone, don't worry about it, and we'll find someone who can help you out with whatever questions you have. 

## Partners
Everything is more fun when you have someone to do it with. You will be assigned someone (or a bunch of people) as your partner by your mentor, and you will work with them as you move forward in this process. We will hot swap partners as we go along. This doesn't mean you're done with them forever (unless you want to be), it just means you have another person to work with.

 If you have someone or a few people you want to be your partner(s), submit their name(s). 

If you don't know anyone, don't worry about it, and we'll find someone who you can work with. Remember, even if you are working on this alone and can't come to meetings, we can still find you a partner... or you can go and recruit some friends to work on it with you. The more the merrier! 

## Twitter
Unsurprisingly, information security Twitter is a very exciting place. In the modern age, where information flows at the speed of light, Twitter is the place to be if you want to stay informed and on the cutting edge. It is a firehose of information, so you want to start off following only a few accounts. It is going to be a lot for you right now to actually try to read and understand the firehose, so we will start you slow and with a small number of beginner-friendly follows that really only post news. If you don't want to do Twitter yet, just skip it. 

Create a "professional" twitter account! Remember, this twitter will be able to be associated with you, even if you want to stay pseudo-anonymous. Always keep it fun and professional. Now subscribe to this list: https://twitter.com/deevnull/lists/cst. This list has been curated to only include must follows with a range of jobs that will provide insight into what is happening around the field. 

Submit your twitter handle below so we can follow you. Again, if you don't want to do Twitter yet, just skip it. It is mostly just a giant waste of time, but it is interesting.

## Github
A major part of hacker culture is the idea of open source technology. What is open source? We will go into it later, but basically it is distributing software for free so that people can use and make changes in order to build the best software possible. GitHub is the modern center of the open source community, providing free hosting for millions of projects. In fact, the entire content of this site is on Github! A great deal of hacker street cred is based around the things you create and release to the public, and the best way to do that is on GitHub. In this course, we use Github to learn good development practices so that you can be a more effective coder.

Then create a GitHub account and submit your username!
