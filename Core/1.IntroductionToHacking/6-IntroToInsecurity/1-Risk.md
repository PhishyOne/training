Use this page to help assess what your risks are:https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/assessing-your-risks

What do you want to protect? Who do you want to protect it from? How likely is it that you will need to protect it? How bad are the consequences if you fail? How much trouble are you willing to go through in order to try to prevent those?

Task 1: Write down a list of data that you keep, where it’s kept, who has access to it, and what stops others from accessing it.

## Risk Assement
NIST IS RISK. 
You probably don't know much right now technically, but technical knowledge is meant to inform your decision making processes, and you can usually get along fairly well on common sense and procedure. Submit a risk assessment for your usna.edu email account following the NIST risk assessment process. 
Provide one or two sentences for each of these 
1. Identify Risks
2. Analyze the Risks
3. Prioritize the Risks
4. Address the Risks
5. Monitor the Risks 

Don't worry about feeling like you don't have much content, we are going to look at this problem again once you have more knowledge and you will approach it very differently.
