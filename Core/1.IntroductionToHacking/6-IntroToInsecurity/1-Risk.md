What, you thought we were too cool for plebe cyber? Absolutely not, parts of that course are some of the best written material on the subject. And the DoD is the best in the world at managing risk.

1. Write a few sentences on the difference between Threats, Vulnerabilities and Risk.
2. Write a few sentences on what makes the risk management tradeoff difficult.
3. What is the risk equation? 
4. Describe the risk management process
5. What are the four principles of ORM?

Use this page to help assess what your risks are:https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/assessing-your-risks

What do you want to protect? Who do you want to protect it from? How likely is it that you will need to protect it? How bad are the consequences if you fail? How much trouble are you willing to go through in order to try to prevent those?

1. Write down a list of data that you keep, where it’s kept, who has access to it, and what stops others from accessing it.
2. Think of four possible threat actors who might want to get a hold of your data or communications. It might be an individual, a government agency, or a corporation.
3. Write down what each adversary might want to do with your private data
4. Write down what the likelihood of each adversary coming for that data
5. Write down what happens if the adversary gets that data
6. Now try to answer the question, how much trouble are you willing to go through in order to prevent loss.
7. Delete everything you just wrote
8. Write a few sentences on why threat modeling is important
9. Undelete everything you just deleted
10. Write down who could have gotten to the list you just deleted
11. Make the decision of whether or not you need to delete the list you just made for yourself. If so, delete it. If you made it on Google Drive, good luck. This is a brain stretching exercie, so don't worry too much. 

One important note is that you might not have anything worth a targeted attack personally, but you have access to other things that might be interesting to other people. For example, your contact lists can be used to identify other, more important targets. Even more dangerous, someone could use your account to send phishes to your contacts. A @usna.edu address is going to have a significantly higher click rate than some random @gmail. You also have access to your network, so someone could use you to pivot to a network you have access to.


## Risk Assement
NIST IS RISK. 
You probably don't know much right now technically, but technical knowledge is meant to inform your decision making processes, and you can usually get along fairly well on common sense and procedure. Submit a risk assessment for your usna.edu email account following the NIST risk assessment process. 

Provide one or two sentences for each of these:
1. Identify Risks
2. Analyze the Risks
3. Prioritize the Risks
4. Address the Risks
5. Monitor the Risks 

Don't worry about feeling like you don't have much content, we are going to look at this problem again once you have more knowledge and you will approach it very differently.
