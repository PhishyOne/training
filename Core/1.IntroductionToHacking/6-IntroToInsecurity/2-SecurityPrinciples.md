# Security Principles

Once again, I really like the plebe cyber version of this. Read this: https://www.usna.edu/CyberDept/sy110/lec/pillarsCybSec/lec.html

CIANA is a very important fundamental concept, make sure that you know it.

Task: For each pillar, submit the word, the definition, and a way that it applies to your email account.

## Immutable Laws
First, immutable means "unchanging over time or unable to be changed". You'll see this word in various contexts throughout computing.The paper 10 Immutable Laws of Security is a seminal paper on why security is hard.

There are plenty of updated versions, but this one is nice because it is totally different.

This might get turned into its own section. I wrote it myself, but it is pretty good. 
I have not broken this down into beginner friendly stuff yet, so read it and google things you don't understand. If you can't understand something using google, message me and I'd love to talk about it. 

Read it, know the things contained, it will help you talk about cyber doctrine/policy.
