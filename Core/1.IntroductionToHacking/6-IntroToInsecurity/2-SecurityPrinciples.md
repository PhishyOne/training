# Security Principles
# CIANA 
Once again, I really like the plebe cyber version of this. Read this: https://www.usna.edu/CyberDept/sy110/lec/pillarsCybSec/lec.html

CIANA is a very important fundamental concept, make sure that you know it.

Task: For each pillar, submit the word, the definition, and a way that it applies to your email account.


## Saltzer and Shroeder 

Read Part A of this: http://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/protection/Basic.html

(Not B, it's super boring.)
You're going to see these guy's names a lot, the paper where they introduced these ideas is widely regarded as the most cited paper in security.

Tasks:
1. Describe the difference between privacy and security and how they relate to each other.
2. List 8 Design Principles and describe why each is important. 
3. Describe why psychological acceptability is the most important of all of these design principles.

There are a couple other security principles worth talking about.. "asset deprecation", "exploit mitigiation", ability to quickly respond. Requires fleshing out but is not required.

## Real World Application 
Read this: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs513/2005fa/NL02.Lampson.pdfTask: 
1. In a few sentences, describe how security principles wind up working in real life.


## Immutable Laws
First, immutable means "unchanging over time or unable to be changed". You'll see this word in various contexts throughout computing.The paper 10 Immutable Laws of Security is a seminal paper on why security is hard.

There are plenty of updated versions, but this one is nice because it is totally different.

If you dont understand what any the laws mean, try to google around to figure it out.

This might get turned into its own section. I wrote it myself, but I'm good. 
Read it, know the things contained, use it to not sound like an idiot if you ever talk about cyber doctrine/policy.
