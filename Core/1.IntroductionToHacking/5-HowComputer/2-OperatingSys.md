   * Virtual Memory
    * On Windows, check to see how much RAM you are using with your virtual machine
    * Check to see how much RAM is being used by your VM and what the CPU utilization looks like
    * Increase RAM allocated to Virutal Machine
    * Check back on your VM to see CPU utilization
    * Decrease RAM to whatever is necessary
