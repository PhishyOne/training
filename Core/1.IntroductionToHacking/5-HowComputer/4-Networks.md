Netowrking is the darkest art... and you will become an expert. But all things considered, you will not be, and do not need to be an expert all the time. You become an expert on things when you need to be, when you have a challenge or a job or for whatever reason, you need to become one of the world's leading experts in parsing specific fields out of an HTTP header. There are people out there who are network wizards who do it for a living. Then there is everybody else who has to relearn everything everytime they go in depth. What we will teach you here is scraping the minimum knowledge required to not need to Google everything. You will still Google everything, but this lets you get into the mix faster and will let you bullshit your way through most things.
