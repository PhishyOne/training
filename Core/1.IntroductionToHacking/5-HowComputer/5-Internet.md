* Google Hacking
     * Google hacking is the general term used for getting the most possible out of the Google search engine. This is done using something called Google Dorks
     * What are google dorks?

        * That strange way of spelling things using numbers and other symbols is called 'leet' speak, or '1337' speak.
        * Read this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet
           * A few things were mentioned here that wind up being important in internet culture. First is BBS, or Bulletin Board Systems. In the early days of dial up internet, BBSs were where the hacking happened. The second notable mention is of the Cult of the Dead Cow, an early internet group that were known for hacktivism, as well as other various online activities. They pop up all the time and were an important part in shaping internet culture.

### Tracking
* A famous quote about the internet is “If a service is free, the product is you”. this applies from social media to news sites to free antivirus. Silicon Valley is built on advertising money, and they make their money targeting advertisements. The more targeted, the more money they can charge. It isn't always advertisments though. Anything can be  turned into a dataset from pictures of your face, your conversations, any behavioral feature, or things like what you buy and what malware you download.
     * Read how it works:
        * https://www.newfangled.com/if-they-are-watching-should-you-watch-too/
        * Describe one potential abuse of tracking and one benefit of tracking in 2-3 sentences. 
    * https://lifehacker.com/5649025/why-you-should-use-adblock-plus-even-if-you-dont-block-ads
        * Describe three benefits of ad-blocking
    * There are many adblockers, not all of them are created equal. Use this one.
        * Install U Block Origin https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/
    * Read this article on the dark side of ad blocking. Be a responsible internet goer.
          * https://arstechnica.com/business/2010/03/why-ad-blocking-is-devastating-to-the-sites-you-love/
    * Install Disconnect and Ghostery

## Search Engines and Tracking
We just taught you about Google hacking, immediately followed by tracking. 
Go to Google, search for "learn how to hack" and click on the Ghostery and UBlock symbols and look at how much tracking is going on at a single page.

Now go to https://duckduckgo.com/ and search for "learn how to hack". Now click the Ghostery and UBlock extensions? You should notice a difference. 

Duck Duck Go cares a lot about privacy. It doesn't have as good search results as Google, but they're not bad. Some people swear by it. Me, I don't really care about Google selling my soul for better advertising. Sorry internet purists. Use Duck Duck Go if you want to be more private, as well as any time Google's algorithms decide that the thing you are searching for is wrong and you should be searching for some slightly related topic that is in the news at the time and shares search terms.

* Wireshark will get a ton more work in the Networking follow on course.
