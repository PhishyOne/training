## Storage Density
   * https://www.dataversity.net/brief-history-data-storage/
   * All that is good information, but the critical thing is that it's all just been progressively smaller ways to store data
   * Nowadays, we use electricity to store 1s and zeros. 
   * It is always useful to know more about electricity https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-electricity
   
   1. Write a brief bit about the importance of storage density. 
    
## Telecommunication Basics
   * Read all of this. 
   * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication
         * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_flag_signalling
         * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_semaphore
         * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code
         * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET
             * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching
   * If you haven't noticed yet, the military cares a lot about sending information. 
   
   * So what did we learn there? 
   1. Write a brief bit about the importance of bits per second.
   2. Write a couple sentences about what ARPANET was.
   
   * How do these ones and zeros work https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/binary
   * What can you represent with all those 1s and 0s. 
   * Do this https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/number-systems-an-introduction-to-binary-hexadecimal-and-more--active-10848
   * Also, hey, what is ascii? This is ascii. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII
   * Also hey, what is hex? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal
    
   0. How many bits are used for each character in ASCII?
   1. "01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100001" is in binary. Conver it back to ASCII. Do it by hand using the chart.
   2. Alright. Now. Convert 17 in Ascii to Binary and Hex. Do it by hand.
   3. Convert "Go Navy" to Octal, Hex, and Binary. Yes. By hand.
   4. What is does "c2l4dHlmb3Vy" translate to from Base64?

* It is annoying to do that by hand, but it does help. Here is a tool so that you never have to do that again. https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/. Fun fact, it is released by GCHQ, Britain's version of the NSA. Great tool and very very useful. There are about a thousand uses for this thing, you can find a bunch on GitHub.

   
## Digital Logic Basics
   * Digital logic: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/digital-logic
   * Read this one too:  https://web.archive.org/web/20061008134026/http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu:80/mastascu/eLessonsHTML/Logic/Logic1.html
    
    
    1. Explain how digital logic is an essential part of computing. 

# Hardware Basics

* Using Google, explain all these things. Put it in a text file.

1. Explain what a motherboard is
2. PCI Slot
3. CPU 
4. Why is a fan needed?
5. RAM
6. Hard Drive
7. Optical Hard Drive
8. Solid State Hard Drive     
9. Graphics Card

* Go to Device Manager and look at your specifications, or "specs".
