    * All that is good information, but the critical thing is that it's all just been progressively smaller ways to use electricity to  store 1s and zeros. 
    * It is always useful to know more about electricity https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-electricity
    * How do these ones and zeros work https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/binary
    * Digital logic https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/digital-logic
    * Do this one too https://web.archive.org/web/20061008134026/http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu:80/mastascu/eLessonsHTML/Logic/Logic1.html

* What can you represent with all those 1s and 0s. 
   * Do this https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/number-systems-an-introduction-to-binary-hexadecimal-and-more--active-10848
   * Also, hey, what is ascii? This is ascii. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII
   * Also hey, what is hex? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal
    
   0. How many bits are used for each character in ASCII?
   1. "01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100001" is in binary. Conver it back to ASCII. Do it by hand using the chart.
   2. Alright. Now. Convert 17 in Ascii to Binary and Hex. Do it by hand.
   3. Convert "Go Navy" to Octal, Hex, and Binary. Yes. By hand.
   4. What is does "c2l4dHlmb3Vy" translate to from Base64?

* It is annoying to do that by hand, but it does help. Here is a tool so that you never have to do that again. https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/. Fun fact, it is released by GCHQ, Britain's version of the NSA. Great tool and very very useful.
