You will spend a ton of time in front of a computer, at a minimum a couple hours, at most, 20 hours straight if you're in a competition or a hackathon... and if 20 hours sounds like too much to you, you're right. There are a few things that require that kind of time in front of a computer, but not many. Usually planning ahead will mitigate that requirement, but hey, maybe the domain controller died, or you have a huge breach response you need to do, or you just need to win this goddamn competition and you're going to have to put that kind of time in. Take care of yourself is the takeaway, but when it comes down to it, long days with the team will be some of your favorite memories, even if it is absolutely self-destructive and unnecessary. You're still in college, your body can take it. Anyway, here are some things to constantly put into practice that will make you a happier and healthier person.

## Blue Light and Brightness
* Drop the brightness on your computer as far as you can. Just trust me.
* Are you used to your eyes hurting after too long on the computer? This is mostly from the blue light. There's a ton of research you can read to prove it, or you can download this and it will change your life. <https://justgetflux.com/ >
* It is also an option to get blue light filtering glasses, they should be pretty cheap (>$30). I swear by mine, but hey, whatever, it keeps my eyes from hurting when I am about to spend 12 hours scrolling pcaps.

## General Wellness

* Hydrate Constantly
   * My life motto is "Stay Happy and Stay Hydrated", and it is inscribed in my class ring... so yeah, I take hydration seriously.

* Sleep
   * Yeah this is important
* Nutrition
   * I'm not going to make you read anything, just don't eat cheetos and hot pockets and drink monsters as your only sustinence for the day. Order in some chinese or Thai. Not every delivery meal has to be Pizza.

* Fitness
   * Not going to beat this one to death, but with an intramural exemption, comes great responsibility. Work out as a team, on your own. Crush the PRT. Never let anyone be able to say that the nerds on the cyber team are not able to pass the run.

* Mental Health
   * The hacker community has a significant amount of mental health concerns above the general norm. The more you know about these concerns and their symptoms, the better you can understand them. Additionally, everyone needs more general suicide prevention and depression training. It's not fun but it is worth having all the resources you can. The Midshipmen Development Center counselors are amazing and are shockingly good at keeping your business private. Always remember that they have to report things, but the system is structured in a way that it will not effect your commission if you can get results with them.
