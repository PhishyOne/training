What, you thought it's all about technical stuff? Hell no! Most of this comes down to you!

## Ergonomics

* Ergonomics 
   * (straight jacked from https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/office-ergonomics/art-20046169 for now)
   * Chair: Choose a chair that supports your spinal curves. Adjust the height of your chair so that your feet rest flat on the floor or on a footrest and your thighs are parallel to the floor. Adjust armrests so your arms gently rest on them with your shoulders relaxed.
   * Key objects: Keep key objects — such as your telephone, stapler or printed materials — close to your body to minimize reaching. Stand up to reach anything that can't be comfortably reached while sitting.
   * Keyboard and mouse: Place your mouse within easy reach and on the same surface as your keyboard. While typing or using your mouse, keep your wrists straight, your upper arms close to your body, and your hands at or slightly below the level of your elbows. Use keyboard shortcuts to reduce extended mouse use. If possible, adjust the sensitivity of the mouse so you can use a light touch to operate it. Alternate the hand you use to operate the mouse by moving the mouse to the other side of your keyboard.
   * Telephone: If you frequently talk on the phone and type or write at the same time, place your phone on speaker or use a headset rather than cradling the phone between your head and neck.
   * Footrest: If your chair is too high for you to rest your feet flat on the floor — or the height of your desk requires you to raise the height of your chair — use a footrest. If a footrest is not available, try using a small stool or a stack of sturdy books instead.
   * Desk: Under the desk, make sure there's clearance for your knees, thighs and feet. If the desk is too low and can't be adjusted, place sturdy boards or blocks under the desk legs. If the desk is too high and can't be adjusted, raise your chair. Use a footrest to support your feet as needed. If your desk has a hard edge, pad the edge or use a wrist rest. Don't store items under your desk.
   * Monitor: Place the monitor directly in front of you, about an arm's length away. The top of the screen should be at or slightly below eye level. The monitor should be directly behind your keyboard. If you wear bifocals, lower the monitor an additional 1 to 2 inches for more comfortable viewing. Place your monitor so that the brightest light source is to the side.
   * The main things are monitor at the right height.
   
* Posture 
   * Have good posture. When sitting, make sure your thighs are parallel to the floor and the armrests are just slightly below your elbows (measure this by sitting in the chair and dropping your arms to your sides). Keyboard height should be one to two inches below your elbows so that your hands while typing, are in a neutral position,” he says. Additionally, although it’s a hard habit to break, try not to cross your legs—instead keep both feet flat on the floor in front of you.

   * It works great for a lot of folk. There are tons of techniques for this, but the secret is you just need an established system to do it and it will be better than anything else you were making up as you go along... that can be applied to literally everything in this world.

## General Wellness

* Hydrate Constantly
   * My life motto is "Stay Happy and Stay Hydrated", and it is inscribed in my class ring... so yeah, I take hydration seriously.

* Nutrition
   * I'm not going to make you read anything, just don't eat cheetos and hot pockets and drink monsters as your only sustinence for the day. Order in some chinese or Thai. Not every delivery meal has to be Pizza. 
   
* Fitness
   * Not going to beat this one to death, but with an intramural exemption, comes great responsibility. Work out as a team, on your own. Crush the PRT. Never let anyone be able to say that the nerds on the cyber team are not able to pass the run. 
   
* Mental Health
   * The hacker community has a significant amount of mental health concerns above the general norm. The more you know about these concerns and their symptoms, the better you can understand them. Additionally, everyone needs more general suicide prevention and depression training. It's not fun but it is worth having all the resources you can. The Midshipmen Development Center counselors are amazing and are shockingly good at keeping your business private. Always remember that they have to report things, but the system is structured in a way that it will not effect your commission if you can get results with them.
