 You are a big bad programmer now, but it has all been done in your browser! Time to learn how to do it from the terminal on your computer(s). This might require some googling..... don't worry, that is literally how programming works. You find something you need to do, and google how to do it. Then you forget how to do it, and you go and google it again the next time you do it. The next bit will help you set up your python environment in your OS's. Setting up environments is very time consuming, no matter what it is, but you will have to do this for every language, and every version of each language, so you will have to get good at it.

Windows

What is a path? You might have to google around to understand it. Hint: If you mess this up, things get interesting.
Linux
https://docs.python.org/3.3/using/unix.html
Along with submitting what a path is, submit a screenshot of you running a .py file from the command line in Windows and Linux!
