You will spend a ton of time in front of a computer, at a minimum a couple hours, at most, 20 hours straight if you're in a competition or a hackathon... and if 20 hours sounds like too much to you, you're right. That is too much. There are a few things that require that kind of time in front of a computer, but not many. Usually planning ahead will mitigate that requirement, but hey, maybe the domain controller died, or you have a huge breach response you need to do, or you just need to win this goddamn competition and you're going to have to put that kind of time in. Take care of yourself is the takeaway, but when it comes down to it, long days with your friends will be some of your favorite memories, even if it is absolutely self-destructive and unnecessary. You're still young, your body can take it. For at least a few years, every once in a while at least. Don't make it a regular thing. Anyway, here are some things to constantly put into practice that will make you a happier and healthier person.

## Ergonomics

1. Now fix your setup so that everything aligns properly. This is an investment.

## Blue Light and Brightness
* Drop the brightness on your computer as far as you can. Just trust me.
* Are you used to your eyes hurting after too long on the computer? This is mostly from the blue light. There's a ton of research you can read to prove it, or you can download this and it will change your life. <https://justgetflux.com/>
   * Windows has this option by default now, so check for that before downloading flux.
* It is also an option to get blue light filtering glasses, they should be pretty cheap (>$30). I swear by mine, but hey, whatever, it keeps my eyes from hurting when I am about to spend 12 hours scrolling packet captures.

## Touch Typing
This is an investment in your productivity, the faster you can type, the better your life will be. This goes for everything you will ever do on a computer. I am so mad I am still learning how to do this. So many hours wasted.

1. Submit a screenshot of the completion for this, and work to continue doing this for the rest of your damn life.


## General Wellness

* Hydrate Constantly
   * My life motto is "Stay Happy and Stay Hydrated", and it is inscribed in my class ring... so yeah, I take hydration seriously.

* Sleep
   * Yeah this is important. Read this: <FINDTHISPLZ>

* Nutrition
   * I'm not going to make you read anything, just don't eat cheetos and hot pockets and drink Monsters as your only sustenance for the day. Order in some Chinese or Thai. Not every delivery meal has to be Pizza. Cook your own food every once in a while. Cooking is fun as hell.
   * Maybe I will, <FINDTHISPLZ>

* Fitness
   * Not going to beat this one to death.

* Mental Health
   * The hacker community has a significant amount of mental health concerns above the general norm. The more you know about these concerns and their symptoms, the better you can understand them. Additionally, everyone needs more general suicide prevention and depression training. It's not fun but it is worth having all the resources you can.
