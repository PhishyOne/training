# Well Shit, You Got Hacked.
## How do we fix that?

We are about to get philisophical. Remember how we were just talking about how there is straight up, NO possible way for us to know if your computer is owned? Well we are about to get into the exact same problem, but now for cleaning your computer. If you have evidence that a malicious program ran on your computer, you can never trust this computer ever again. That tiny PUP that kept changing your homepage to some chinese marketplace could have been bundled with some nation state rootkit that overwrote your computer's foundational code down at the soul of the device and you aren't going to be able to remove that malware unless you return the silicon into sand.  

However, that is very, very, very unlikely. As we have said before, you are not going to be targeted by nation states, or really anyone at all. If you get hacked, almost certainly by an untargeted attack, the malware will drop itself off, establish persistence, and then do its thing. While there have been examples in the past of standard malware going for rootkit persistence, that is significantly more difficult on modern operating systems. 99% of the time, if antivirus identifies the malware and removes it, you are good and don't have to worry about any follow on problems. Sure, that does leave room for the next 1%, so my recommendation is remove the malware, let that computer chill for a day or two if you can afford to use another, and then run the malware scan again. If you keep finding malware you have a bigger problem, but the rest of the time, you can just go back to using the computer as normal. It is no life to buy a new computer every time you mess up, and it get's expensive fast.

So with all that said, if you use your computer for nuclear launch codes, critical intellectual property, or managing the crypto wallets of your hoarded wealth in addition to casual internet surfing, don't destroy the pwned computer. Buy a new computer to do your serious business, and then clean up the old one as best you can and use the old computer to surf the web. Compartmentalization is key. 

## So how do I get it clean again? 

Can't do better than this guide.

## What would happen if the malware doesn't all get deleted on the first run? 

Persistence

Rootkit/bootkit persistence

## Repeat Attack Vectors

* Patching
     * If you haven't patched, you are still vulnerable!
* Attachments
     * If you, or someone else keeps getting hit with attachments/etc, they need some user training
* Pirated Software
     * If you keep downloading pirated shit, you will keep getting popped. That is just how it goes.
