# OPSEC is king

If someone has found you in real life, the game is over. There are all sorts of great technical approaches to protecting yourself we have gone over already, but technology only goes so far. There is always a log created digitally and if a motivated attacker wants you, they will get you technically. OPSEC is what keeps you off the radar, and if you are going to be on the radar, gives them a cold trail and a fake account to chase into the ground. If you follow these rules, you will do much better towards not getting arrested.

# Physical attacks

A physical attack on your computer, called an "Evil Maid", is a classic attack and near impossible to defeat. If someone has hands on keyboard after stealing your device, they own that computer unless you have full disk encryption. If you have full disk encryption and someone modifies the computer, then you use it, then you are screwed. If someone has you and the computer, you are screwed. Long story short, it is better for them to not know you are worth attacking, thus, OPSEC.
