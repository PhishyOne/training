## This Shit is Hard 
Doing cool things with computers is hard, and yes there is an aspect that requires technical knowledge, but mostly, it just takes time. Doing cool things with computers is less of a technical challenge and more of an attitude and a willingness to work hard and teach yourself what you need to know in order to succeed in whatever you are trying to do. Our curriculum here is meant to give you the basic tools you will need to understand the challenges you face, but solving them is going to be on you. We'll be honest, this isn't easy. This isn't something that will take you a month or two to get the hang of. One of the primary curses of doing cool shit with computers is that each time you learn something, you immediately realize a new pile of things that you do not know. There's nothing wrong with not knowing things, and no one could ever expect you to. Even "experts" will only know a small slice of the greater field that is doing cool things with computers. Expecting anyone to be good at everything is ridiculous, but it is even more ridiculous for anyone to think a beginner should know everything... or really, anything. There's a lot of acronyms, slang, in-jokes, and domain specific knowledge. One of the promises we will make to you is that we will not ever put in an acronym, slang, or in-joke without explaining it. If you can stick with and complete this course, you will be armed with the baseline knowledge and attitude you need to be able to learn anything. Probably the most important skill you will learn is how to use all of your resources effectively, whether that is your classmates, teachers, reference pages, or Google. Mostly, Google. It will take a year or two before you get comfortable and stop feeling totally lost every day, but then you'll just start working on harder problems and you'll wind up more confused than you could imagine being now. Being good at computering is a long term process of reinforcing and building on the basic knowledge we will teach you in this course, and it will never end until you decide the computers have won. Don't let the computers win, and keep learning everything you can. 


## The Hacker Attitude 

Read this post: [http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) It isn't perfect, but it will do for now until I write a new one. 

While there is a lot in there that is very interesting, the most important part is the hacker attitude.

[1. The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved.](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#believe1)

[2.No problem should ever have to be solved twice.](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#believe2)

[3. Boredom and drudgery are evil.](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#believe3)

[4. Freedom is good.](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#believe4)

[5. Attitude is no substitute for competence.](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#believe5)

These 5 statements provide a reasonable framework for how you should approach learning this material. It should be fun, we shouldn't be wasting your time, there should be multiple ways for you to succeed, and we are measuring success by your ability at the end. Make sure you've really read through the post and then w<span style="font-size: 1rem;">rite 4-6 sentences on your interpretation of the last sentence in part one of the Hacker Attitude, “You also have to develop a kind of faith in your own learning capacity — a belief that even though you may not know all of what you need to solve a problem, if you tackle just a piece of it and learn from that, you'll learn enough to solve the next piece — and so on, until you're done.”

## The Hacker Ethic

From the same site as the Hacker How-To comes this brief description of the hacker ethic. Eventually I'll write something else, but for now this is good enough.   

Read it: [http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker-ethic.html](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker-ethic.html)

It breaks the hacker ethic into two main beliefs: 


1. The belief that information-sharing is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by writing open-source code and facilitating access to information and to computing resources wherever possible.

2. The belief that system-cracking for fun and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.

A longer version of the hacker ethic comes from the famous book _Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution_ that you probably should read someday, but there is no rush. I haven't read the whole thing yet.  

The wikipedia article is pretty good so read it: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic)

They come out to 5 key beliefs:

1. Access to computers—and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works—should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!  
2. All information should be free (Often a topic of debate, he means free as in speech, rather than free as in beer) 
3. Mistrust authority—promote decentralization
4. Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.
5. You can create art and beauty on a computer. The concept of "hack value" is doing something that is worth doing because of the "playful cleverness" required. 
6.  Computers can change your life for the better

Write a few sentences on what matters in the hacker ethic.  


## Sharing

One of the key parts of this mindset is sharing knowledge with others. A great quote on the subject is 'There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.'  Not to mention, the more you give back to the community, the greater the value you provide. If you're just starting off, you might not think you have anything to provide, but in fact, you're looking at the world with a different perspective than someone who has done it for years. For example, you can provide feedback on when training makes no sense or isn't as effective as it could be, and help make it easier for the next person to go through it. This site is a work in progress and the more feedback we receive the better it will be.  

With that said, you're definitely going to have questions. There are nearly infinite resources out there, and it is rare that you wind up doing something no one has ever done before. If you think you are there, message someone or make a post in the forum so we can all look for resources, and congratulations. Before that you have google and people here to help you, and we will always try to help in any way that we can. One of the worst things about hacker culture is this idea that someone should “Read the Fucking Manual” or “RTFM”. The first recorded use of this was in a user manual for some program in 1979, so it goes way back. On first glance, RTFM is a great response for any question that should have been answered by a casual glance at the manual. The problem with this idea is that a large body of knowledge is usually required to understand the manual, and even before that, you need to know the manual exists. If you are taking this course, there is no possible way you can be expected to understand a manual because you are just getting started. The most common "manual" you will come across in this course and your travels through hackerdom are the man-pages that accompany every single aspect of the Unix operating system, and they are a great resource for people who have spent years learning how to understand them. Right now, you don’t have the knowledge to be expected to understand how they work, and that is fine. There is no pressure to know anything, but there is pressure to learn. 

The comic web site Xkcd is a nerd cultural treasure and you will see it referenced constantly. Remember, you don’t have to get them all, when you are not sure, there is http://www.explainxkcd.com. Read [this comic](https://xkcd.com/1692/), and hover your mouse over it to get the alt-text. Submit what the alt-text tells you to do.  

You might be thinking to yourself... what is alt-text? Funny you ask that. Depending on your current browser, figure out how to view the web page's source code. This might require some Googling. What you are looking at is hypertext markup language or HTML for short. HTML is the language that websites are made of. If you already knew that, good for you. You will learn a great deal more later, but for now, look at the code and find where the main picture is stored in the webpage. Now do you understand what alt-text means? Submit the entire tag, starting with < and ending with >.

### In Defense of RTFM 
RTFM gets a bad rap for good reason, because it is usually used as a put down on someone who doesn't know much about a subject... with that said, once you have the knowledge to understand a topic, if you are using that software, you should read the manual. Even if you don't understand the manual, if you are going to ask a question, you might as well reference that you know the manual exists and that what you are asking is referenced, you just need clarification. People have made great guides on how to ask questions effectively, and if you follow those guides, you will find you understand your initial question and the topic much better than if you had someone explain the answer to just your specific question. 

## Google 

The same goes for Let Me Google That For You, or LMGTFY if an answer can be solved with a verbatim search of the question asked. There are very very few questions you are going to ask that Google can't answer. But sometimes your questions might be a little too vague to make sense, or you don't really know what you are trying to find out. Luckily, you have people here who can help you. One of the best questions you can ask is for search terms on a subject. That way they don't have to spend time explaining it, and you get all the benefits of doing the research yourself. You might already know some cool google tricks to get better results, but don't worry... we will teach you all of them until you are wise in the ways of Google Fu.

For now, check out this site with [Google tricks](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-google-search-tips-pdf/) and submit a screenshot of the search results for Hopper's Roppers using the operator symbol that only returns results that include all terms within quotes in the exact given order.

## Questions

This guy is a bit of a jerk, and kind of a bad person, but he has good content. We're not as mean as him, and I'll write something better eventually.

Read this: http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html  

You can private message us, post on the forum, throw it on Slack, whatever. Just show you tried ahead of time and no one will ever get annoyed, because there is really no such thing as a bad question, just one you haven't researched enough. 

If you're in person, just ask. It's faster than googling and you'll get more out of it. 

We already told you what RTFM stood for, so now we're gonna have you do it. 

Visit this [man-page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/bash) and write down the first five things you don’t understand. Then google them and figure out what they are. Submit 5 sentences explaining the 5 things you didn’t know. For the love of everything, don’t read any further once you are done with that. Remember Rule 3 of the Hacker Attitude, “Boredom and Drudgery are evil.” If you're not getting anything out of something at any point in this course, don't do it, and leave us feedback that we are wasting your time.

## Brainwashing 

As we said before, hacking is a mindset, not a skillset. Sure you'll pick up plenty of useful skills along the way, but the primary benefit of the hacker mentality is being able to look at the world, see a problem you've never approached before, and figure out how to solve it. We are trying to cultivate that mindset, and yes, we are going to try to subtly brainwash you. We're not sorry about it. Genuine interest and drive are the two best indicators of success in this field, and we want to encourage it as much as we possibly can. How do we teach that? How do we measure that? We don't know. If we were pretentious losers we might say we're trying to hack your brain into becoming a hacker. But we're not. So lets call it brainwashing. Are you okay with being brainwashed?*
