# The Hacker Mindset
## This Shit is Hard
Doing cool things with computers is hard, and sure there is a technical aspect, but mostly, it just takes time. 

Doing cool things with computers is less of a technical challenge and more of an attitude and a willingness to work hard and teach yourself what you need to know in order to succeed in whatever you are trying to do. Our curriculum here is meant to give you the basic tools you will need to understand the challenges you face, but solving them is going to be on you. We'll be honest, this isn't easy. This isn't something that will take you a month or two to get the hang of. One of the primary curses of doing cool shit with computers is that each time you learn something, you immediately realize a new pile of things that you do not know. There's nothing wrong with not knowing things, and no one could ever expect you to. Even "experts" will only know a small slice of the greater field that is doing cool things with computers. Expecting anyone to be good at everything is ridiculous, but it is even more ridiculous for anyone to think a beginner should know everything or really, anything. There's  a lot of acronyms, slang, in-jokes, and domain specific knowledge. But if you can stick with and complete this course, you will be armed with the baseline knowledge and attitude you need to be able to learn anything. It will take a year or two before you get comfortable and stop feeling totally lost every day, but then you'll just start working on harder problems and you'll wind up more confused than you could imagine being now. Being good at computering is a long term process of reinforcing and building on the basic knowledge we will teach you in this course, and it will never end until you decide the computers have won. 

Don't let the computers win, and keep learning everything you can.

## The Hacker Attitude
Read this post: <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html</a>It isn't perfect, but it will do for now until I write a new one.&nbsp;</p><p>While there is a lot in there that is very interesting, the most important part is the hacker attitude.</p><p></p><dt><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#believe1">1. The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved.</a></dt><dt><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#believe2">2. No problem should ever have to be solved twice.</a></dt><dt><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#believe3">3. Boredom and drudgery are evil.</a></dt><dt><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#believe4">4. Freedom is good.</a></dt><dt><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#believe5">5. Attitude is no substitute for competence.</a></dt><p></p><p>These 5 statements provide a reasonable framework for how you should approach learning this material. It should be fun, we shouldn't be wasting your time, there should be multiple ways for you to succeed, and we are measuring success by your ability at the end. Make sure you've really read through the post and the w<span style="font-size: 1rem;">rite 4-6 sentences on your interpretation of the last sentence in part one of the Hacker Attitude, “(You also have to develop a kind of faith in your own learning capacity — a belief that even though you may not know all of what you need to solve a problem, if you tackle just a piece of it and learn from that, you'll learn enough to solve the next piece — and so on, until you're done.)”</span></p> 

## The Hacker Ethic
<p><ul><li>From the same site as the Hacker How-To comes this brief description of the hacker ethic. Eventually I'll write something else, but for now this is good enough.&nbsp;<br></li></ul></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Read it: <a href="http://* &quot;Hacker Ethic&quot;       * http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker-ethic.html">http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker-ethic.html</a></span></p><p>It breaks the hacker ethic into two main beliefs:&nbsp;</p><p></p><dd><p><a id="hacker-ethic">1. The belief that information-sharing is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by writing open-source code and facilitating access to information and to computing resources wherever possible.</a></p></dd><dd><p><a id="hacker-ethic">2. The belief that system-cracking for fun and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.</a></p><p>A longer version of the hacker ethic comes from the famous book <i>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution </i>that you probably should read someday.&nbsp;</p><p>The wikipedia article is pretty good so read it:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic</a></p><p>They come out to 5 key beliefs:</p><p>1. Access to computers—and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works—should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!<br></p><p>2. All information should be free</p><p>(Often a topic of debate, he means free as in speech, rather than free as in beer)&nbsp;</p><p>3.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Mistrust authority—promote decentralization</span></p><p>4.&nbsp;Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.</p><p>5. You can create art and beauty on a computer.</p><p>The concept of "hack value" is doing something that is worth doing because of the "playful cleverness" required.&nbsp;</p><p>6. &nbsp;Computers can change your life for the better</p><p></p></dd><br>Write a few sentences on what matters in the hacker ethic.<br><p></p>

## Sharing
<p>One of the key parts of this mindset is sharing knowledge with others. A great quote on the subject is 'There is&nbsp;<em>nothing noble</em>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>being superior</em>&nbsp;to your fellow man; true nobility is&nbsp;<em>being superior</em>&nbsp;to your former self.' &nbsp;Not to mention, the more you give back to the community, the higher your value. If you're just starting off, you might not think you have anything to provide, but in fact, you're looking at the world with a different perspective than someone who has done it for years. For example, you can provide feedback on when training makes no sense or isn't as effective as it could be, and help make it easier for the next person to go through it.&nbsp;</p><p>With that said, you're definitely going to have questions. There are nearly infinite resources out there, and it is rare that you wind up doing something no one has ever done before. If you think you are there, make a post in the forum so we can all look for resources, and congratulations. Before that you have google and people here to help you, and we will always try to help in any way that we can. One of the worst things about hacker culture is this idea that someone should “Read the Fucking Manual” or “RTFM”. The first recorded use of this was in a user manual for some program in 1979, so it goes way back. On first glance, RTFM is a great response for any question that should have been answered by a casual perusal of the manual. The problem with this idea is that a large body of knowledge is usually required to understand the manual. If you are taking this course, there is no possible way you can be expected to understand a manual because you are just getting started. The most common "manual" you will come across in this course and your travels through hackerdom are the man-pages that accompany every single aspect of the Unix operating system, and they are a great resource for people who have spent years learning how to understand them. Right now, you don’t have the knowledge to be expected to understand how they work, and that is fine. There is no pressure to know anything, but there is pressure to learn.&nbsp;</p><p>Xkcd is a nerd cultural treasure and you will see it referenced constantly. Remember, you don’t have to get them all, when you are not sure, there is http://www.explainxkcd.com. Read <a href="https://xkcd.com/1692/">this comic</a>, and hover your mouse over it to get the alt-text. Submit what the alt-text tells you to do.&nbsp;<br></p>

### In Defense of RTFM 
RTFM gets a bad rap for good reason, because it is usually used as a put down on someone who doesn't know much about a subject... with that said, once you have the knowledge to understand a topic, if you are using that software, you should read the manual. Even if you don't understand the manual, if you are going to ask a question, you might as well reference that you know the manual exists and that what you are asking is referenced, you just need clarification. I plan on making an infographic of asking questions. 

## Google
The same goes for Let Me Google That For You, or LMGTFY if an answer can be solved with a verbatim search of the question asked.

There are very very few questions you are going to ask that Google can't answer. But sometimes your questions might be a little too vague to make sense, or you don't really know what you are trying to find out.

Luckily, you have people here who can help you. 

One of the best questions you can ask is for search terms on a subject. That way they don't have to spend time explaining it, and you get all the benefits of doing the research yourself.

You might already know some cool google tricks to get better results, but don't worry... we will teach you all of them.

## Questions
<p>This guy is a bit of a jerk, but he has good content. We're not as mean as him, and I'll write something better eventually.</p><p>Read this: http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html<br></p><p>You can private message us, post on the forum, throw it on Slack, whatever. Just show you tried ahead of time and no one will ever get annoyed, because there is really no such thing as a bad question, just one you haven't researched enough.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're in person, just ask. It's faster than googling and you'll get more out of it.&nbsp;</p><p>We already told you what RTFM stood for, so now we're gonna have you do it.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Visit this <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/bash">man-page</a> and write down the first five things you don’t understand.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Then google them and figure out what they are. Submit 5 sentences explaining the 5 things you didn’t know.&nbsp;For the love of everything, don’t read any further once you are done with that. Remember Rule 3 of the Hacker Attitude, “Boredom and Drudgery are evil.” If you're not getting anything out of something, don't do it, and leave us feedback that we are wasting your time.</span></p><p></p>

## Brainwashing
 As we said before, hacking is a mindset, not a skillset. Sure you'll pick up plenty of useful skills along the way, but the primary benefit of the hacker mentality is being able to look at the world, see a problem you've never approached before, and figure out how to solve it. We are trying to cultivate that mindset, and yes, we are going to try to subtly brainwash you. We're not sorry about it. Genuine interest and drive are the two best indicators of success in this field, and we want to encourage it as much as we possibly can. How do we teach that? How do we measure that? We don't know. If we were pretentious losers we might say we're trying to hack your brain into becoming a hacker. But we're not. So lets call it brainwashing. 



Are you okay with being brainwashed?*









* Note: This probably is not legally binding.

## Continuous Learning
Learning this stuff isn't easy. The content is difficult, the scope of what there is to learn is tremendous, and the rate of innovation and change in this space makes keeping up seemingly impossible. If you are thinking right now that you'll never learn everything; you're right! There is an infinite amount to learn, so choose the stuff that interests you and learn that. This course is intended to give you a general base of knowledge so that you can succeed with anything you do, but if you want to be great you have to love what you're doing and keep getting after it. 


For the rest of your time computering, maintain a series of lists. I recommend a Google Sheets file with a bunch of tabs. These are just a few we recommend, I'm sure you'll make more.

* Questions you don't know the search terms for
* Questions that google can't answer
* Things you want to learn how to do
* Things you want to learn more about
* Things you want to make or help make
* Things you want to tell other people about or write about
* Potential future reading material  
* Links to things you want to remember

 We will do our absolute best to help you keep these lists short. There will be section in the forums for random questions, from ELI5 style to "Make me a tutorial", or you can always just private message it, or put it up in Slack.  



Task: Make a copy of ____ this file ___and keep it updated.
