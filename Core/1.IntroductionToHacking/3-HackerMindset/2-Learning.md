## Learning How to Learn

We all want to better at learning... but how do we do that? First, what is learning, and how do we do that better?

The defacto course to learn this is: <https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn>
It was made by Dr. Barbara Oakley who has also written the definitive book on the subject. It is a free course, so take it if you want to. It should take less than 17 hours to complete and will teach you things you will carry forward for the rest of your life.

Or, you can read this <https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/5950tm/text_i_just_finished_the_online_coursera_course/> Reddit post which contains notes from the course.

Now, will you learn the information from this sheet of notes as well as if you had learned from the 17 hour course? Probably not honestly. Learning is complicated as hell and that course is designed to be just about perfect for how to learn. But reading something in a half hour is definitely easier for you right now to get an idea of what you should do to be more effective as a learner. At some point in the future you should take the entire course, but I don't want to break up the flow of this course tooo badly.

From the same person as the course "Learning How to Learn" comes these quick notes on good study habits. <http://www.math.toronto.edu/nhoell/10rules-of-studying.pdf>

## Spaced Repetition
Learn about spaced repetition here! This first iteration of the course does not have particularly much, but in the long run, I plan on having a great deal of it. Space repetition and Anki will change your academic life. If you are still in school, you owe it to yourself to start using this for all subjects.

## Ten Thousand Hours and Deep Work
You might have heard of the 10,000 hours thing or Deep Work. Here are some good references to read to help you understand some of the science (and art) behind getting good at hard things.

## How to Read
Can't go wrong being better at reading.

## Methods
Give the Pomodoro technique a try. It works great for a lot of folk. There are tons of productivity techniques and systems, but the secret is you just need an established system to do it and it will be better than anything else you were making up as you go along... that can be applied to literally everything in this world. Whether it is productivity, exercise, nutrition, or hey, learning things like this course, you will always benefit from some sort of formalized system. The worst system in the world for anything is better than no system at all.

## Continuous Learning

Learning this stuff isn't easy. The content is difficult, the scope of what there is to learn is tremendous, and the rate of innovation and change in this space makes keeping up seemingly impossible. If you are thinking right now that you'll never learn everything; you're right! There is an infinite amount to learn, so choose the stuff that interests you and learn that. This course is intended to give you a general base of knowledge so that you can succeed with anything you do, but if you want to be great you have to love what you're doing and keep getting after it. For the rest of your time computering, maintain a series of lists. I recommend a Google Sheets file with a bunch of tabs. These are just a few we recommend, I'm sure you'll make more.

* Questions you don't know the search terms for
* Questions that google can't answer
* Things you want to learn how to do
* Things you want to learn more about
* Things you want to make or help make
* Things you want to tell other people about or write about
* Potential future reading material
* Links to things you want to remember

We will do our absolute best to help you keep these lists short. There will be section in the Slack for random questions, from ELI5 style to "Make me a tutorial", or you can always just private message it.
