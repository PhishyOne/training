## Learning How to Learn

We all want to better at learning... but how do we do that? First, what is learning, and how do we do that better?

The defacto course to learn this is: https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn
It was made by Dr. Barbara Oakley who has also written the definitive book on the subject. It is a free course, so take it if you want to. It should take less than 17 hours to complete and will teach you things you will carry forward for the rest of your life. 

Or, you can read this https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/5950tm/text_i_just_finished_the_online_coursera_course/ Reddit post which contains notes from the course. 

Now, will you learn the information from this sheet of notes as well as if you had learned from the 17 hour course? Probably not honestly. Learning is complicated as hell and that course is designed to be just about perfect for how to learn. But reading something in a half hour is definitely easier for you right now to get an idea of what you should do to be more effective as a learner. At some point in the future you should take the entire course, but I don't want to break up the flow of this course tooo badly.

From the same person as the course "Learning How to Learn" comes these quick notes on good study habits. http://www.math.toronto.edu/nhoell/10rules-of-studying.pdf

Relevant XKCD: https://xkcd.com/1053/

* Emphasis on balance between focus and diffuse mode: taking a walk or exercising after a focused study session.

* Spaced repetition: Anki works wonders. Reviewing notes multiple times is also tremendous.

* Sleep: ignored the importance of this for so long, but it helps so much.
