## Letter from the Author

### *my name is dennis and I like computers.* 

Computers are special because they are not wrong. They execute the instructions they are given by humans and the result that comes out the other end is exactly what they were told to do.  If it makes a mistake, it's because a human screwed it up. We can change those instructions into anything and because of this, we can do anything. We can catch up on the news, read books, look at pictures and watch movies. We can learn anything. We can talk to our friends, make music, write books, create art. We can create knowledge. We can write new software. We can share what we have made with strangers. 

The world is a place filled with good people, and bad people, and people in between just trying to get by. The internet reflects the world that gave birth to it. It is a place where you can be exposed to the best of humanity and the worst of humanity in a single burst of electrons. The internet is a bad place sometimes. The world can be a bad place sometimes too. 

But if you are reading this, you have superpowers. You have access to the sum of humanity’s knowledge. You can speak to billions of other people at any time. You can create software that does what you told it to do. What you build can be used by other people to create change in the world. You can use what you build to make the world a better place. 

There is a dark side to all of this that cannot be ignored. Not everyone is working to make the world a better place, and they have all the superpowers that you do. But you have a responsibility to use your power for good, and do what you can to change the world into a place that is more safe, more free, more filled with wonder, and more beautiful than the world without you and without technology in it. 

### *"Give me a place to stand, and a lever long enough, and I will move the world"*

You stand on a platform larger than any platform imaginable up until the dawn of this age of technology. Your lever consists of the sum of human knowledge and the sum of humanity’s technological progress. If you want to move the world, all you need to do is lean on it.
