13. Then use bashrc to build a permanent alias using the same article. Read this article https://medium.com/@tzhenghao/a-guide-to-building-a-great-bashrc-23c52e466b1c to get an idea of some other things you can do with a bashrc. Your bashrc can be as complicated or simple as you like, and there is near endless customization possible. You will be able to carry this around between VMs with you to automatically personalize it as soon as you load in the bashrc so its just like home. 
Bashrc is part of a group of files called dotfiles, so named because they have a dot in front of their names. This makes them "hidden" files in the Linux directory system. Dotfiles are almost always used to store configuration settings.
