12. Create a temporary alias to save some typing on a frequently used command. https://www.tecmint.com/create-alias-in-linux/

13. Then use bashrc to build a permanent alias using the same article. Read this article https://medium.com/@tzhenghao/a-guide-to-building-a-great-bashrc-23c52e466b1c to get an idea of some other things you can do with a bashrc. Your bashrc can be as complicated or simple as you like, and there is near endless customization possible. You will be able to carry this around between VMs with you to automatically personalize it as soon as you load in the bashrc so its just like home. 
Bashrc is part of a group of files called dotfiles, so named because they have a dot in front of their names. This makes them "hidden" files in the Linux directory system. Dotfiles are almost always used to store configuration settings.

### Introduction to Man Pages

2. For each step, write why you are doing it, what the critical security controls being added are, and any issues you had doing it. This will require some google. Once you are done, submit your list.

### The Final Boss of Your Linux Introduction

Complete http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/. This is a classic set of challenges that every member of our team has fought through, and while it takes some time, you should have had enough experience to figure out what you need to do. It won't be easy, it might not be the most fun, but completion of this challenge is the single greatest determining factor in whether or now you continue along this journey. Let us know if you get stuck on any challenge for longer than a half hour, we will gladly point you in the right direction. And no cheating, as Hemingway once said, “There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.” We like Hemingway. He  was a big fan of boats and alcohol and adventures. We are too.
