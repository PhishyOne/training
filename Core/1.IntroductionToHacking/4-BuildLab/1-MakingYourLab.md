# Building Your Own Lab
## Introduction
Building your own lab is important for a lot of reasons, but most importantly it is fun and teaches you a bunch of valuable information. In this section we will do some work securing our daily lives and install a virtual machine for us to work on. What you will be making is uniquely yours and will be something that you will work on and refine for the rest of your time doing the computers. This is your new workbench/hangout spot, so take pride in what you are making and make it yours.

## Virtualization
Why do we use virtualization?

Write up a few sentences on the primary benefits of running a virtualized environment inside of your Windows machine.

## Installing Ubuntu in VMWare
Install VMware http://www.vmware.com/go/tryplayerpro-win-64

Install Ubuntu https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop

I could give you more information on what to do for this, but there are a ton of tutorials and youtube videos out there. Should be an easy google, and the information doesn't change too much. Let us know if you have any problems, but I recommend going step by step through a tutorial. This is your first challenge that we are telling you to figure it out yourself.

You might notice we always try to link to the source of things, even dank memes. It's a weird thing to care about, but it is so easy to repost images without any way of crediting the author. 

## Make it Yours
Now you need to make this house a home, have fun with it. This is a random smattering of things that I highly recommend you do, both for quality of life and for getting accustomed to how things work.



Tasks:
1. What the heck is sudo? sudo https://www.lifewire.com/ubuntu-sudo-2205669. Submit what sudo is. 
2. Do everything on the First 10 Minutes Guide. Read this: https://www.codelitt.com/blog/my-first-10-minutes-on-a-server-primer-for-securing-ubuntu/ It won't take you 10 minutes. Probably more like an hour or two. You will have to use other resources than just this post.
3. For each step, write why you are doing it, what the critical security controls being added are, and any issues you had doing it. This will require some google. Once you are done, submit your list.
4. Install VMWare tools for Ubuntu.
You need this for a lot of critical usability things, and it doesn't come pre-installed. You have most likely already seen prompts telling you to do this. Do it. I'll be honest, this can be kinda difficult sometimes, but you gotta figure your own way through this. Again, if you have any trouble, and this takes more than a half hour to figure out, call someone over or message us and we will help you out. There is no shame, I've had VMs before that I gave up trying to install VMWare tools and just sucked it up for a week. You'll be on this VM for a while, so you need to get it installed.
